## App Architecture

**Lythm** follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture combined with **Clean Architecture** principles. This ensures that the app is modular, maintainable, and scalable. Here's a brief breakdown:

- **Model**: Represents the data layer, which interacts with external sources like local storage (Content Resolver) and network APIs.
- **View**: Represents the UI, built with **Jetpack Compose**, which reacts to state changes in the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel**: The logic layer that holds UI-related data and interacts with UseCases to fetch or modify data. The ViewModel is lifecycle-conscious and designed to survive configuration changes like screen rotations.

## Technology Stack

**Lythm** uses the following technologies to provide a seamless and efficient user experience:

- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern toolkit for building native Android UIs using a declarative approach.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: The app architecture ensures separation of concerns and clear responsibilities between UI and logic.
- **Clean Architecture**: Helps maintain a clear separation of concerns, making the app easier to scale and maintain.
- **Use Cases**: Use Cases encapsulate the business logic, ensuring that the ViewModel remains thin and focused on UI-related operations.
- **Coil**: Used for image loading, like album art or cover images, to ensure smooth and fast image handling.
- **Splash API**: A feature to display a splash screen that loads essential data asynchronously at the start of the app.
- **Content Resolver**: Interacts with the device's storage to access and manage music files.
- **Fancy Toasts**: The app uses customized toasts to give a more engaging and visually appealing user experience.

## Features in Detail

- **Play Music (Basic)**:  
  The core feature of Lythm allows users to play any audio file stored on their device. The app detects supported audio formats and plays them using an efficient media player service.

- **List Play**:  
  Users can browse through their entire music library, sorted by different criteria (name, year, artist, etc.), and play their music in a list format. This helps users discover their music with ease.

- **Personal Playlist**:  
  Lythm allows users to create their own playlists. They can add or remove songs, manage playlist names, and access them quickly from the home screen.

- **Sorting**:  
  Sorting functionality enables users to arrange their music collection by artist, year, album, song name, and other metadata, giving them an organized and personalized experience.

- **Lyrics Embedding**:  
  Lyrics are embedded into the music files, so users can follow along with the lyrics while enjoying their favorite tracks.

## How It Works
